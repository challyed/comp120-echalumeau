# README.md
I thought this one was staightforward.
Worked 1 hour
I do want to know if I added the text correctly because there is .innerHTML and then .innertext.
 Also was the use of 'br' tag right?

## Review of directons and points
- [x] modify the JavaScript function loadMessages to parse the JSON data, 
- [x] output the messages with corresponding usernames in the "messages" section of the HTML example below
```
Messages 
Do you really want to hurt me? Boy
Do you really want to make me cry? Geroge 

```
