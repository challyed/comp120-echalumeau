This is the readme file. 
This lab took 3+ hours. I Looked at WC3 school and the links provided.
In addition, I asked for help on Piazza. 
While doing this lab, I decided to organzie each screen by color to check the responsiveness. 
This means when the width was 1200px, there would be a red outline but if there was bewteen 1100 to 1200, it was orange. When I figured that out I replaced it with the right screen.
I did kind of guess on the object positions to me it looks right but I am unsure about the "screen not found" pictures.
